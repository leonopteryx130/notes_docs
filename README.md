# Introduction

I am a web developer and I have written lots of notes in my daily study life, I decided to share with others by published on github.

I marked these notes in OneNote(a Microsoft application), it will take me some time to convert words to markdown, I can use some spare time to finish it.

I am a Chinese, so it is convenient to write in Chinese. Maybe I will write an English version someday if it has a lot of stars.
